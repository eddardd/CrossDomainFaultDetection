# Dynamic Systems

This module is intended for the simulation of dynamic systems. It is composed of two sub-modules:

1. simulation, which contains classes for dynamic systems simulation (e.g. abstract dynamic system, and two study cases, two-tanks and CSTR),
2. controller, which contains classes for process control. For now, only a PID controller is implemented.

## Implementation Goals

* [x] Two-Tanks System
* [x] Continuously Stirred Tank Reactor
* [x] PID Controller
